This repository contains the files used to build a website presenting my internship.

It uses the static site generator [Hugo](gohugo.io) with a port of the [Dimension theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/dimension/) from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

# Installation

To build the website yourself follow the [instructions to install](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) Hugo or simply [download a binary](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) which do not require installation. Then simply run Hugo with no arguments and it should generate a folder called `public` in your current directory.
